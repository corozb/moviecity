# Movie City

This project is about a dynamic website where we use Vanilla Javascript to make a search from the **API** of [YTS.lts](https://yts.lt/api) and a list of friends online using the **API** of [Random User Generator](https://randomuser.me/), if you click over any friend we can see all the info about them, like whole name, phone number, email, etc.
<br/> 
This site shows a cartel with differents genres, we can pick a movie and see a short synopsis in the modal or search it in the search box.

- HTML - CSS - JAVASCRIPT
- PostCSS
- CSS Grid
- jQuery
- localStorage to keep the data

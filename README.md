# Movie City

This project is about a dynamic website where we use Vanilla Javascript to make a search from [YTS.lts](https://yts.lt/api) API and create a list of friends online using the [Random User Generator](https://randomuser.me/) API, if you click over any friend we can see all the info about them, like whole name, phone number, email, etc.
This site shows a cartel with differents genres, we can pick a movie and see a short synopsis in the modal or search it in the search box.


In this project I used:
- HTML - CSS - JAVASCRIPT
- PostCSS
- CSS Grid
- jQuery
- localStorage to keep the data 
- Cache Memory
